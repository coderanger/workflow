Experiments in async Python
===========================

This is a proof-of-concept for a special Python environment that can make
code asynchronous in a transparent manner.

To run it, first start ``workflow/adder_service.py`` in one terminal and then
``workflow/app.py`` in another. If all goes correctly, you should see the line
``COMPLETE: 4`` print out from app.py after a short delay.
